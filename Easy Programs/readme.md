Reverse A Number In Java – We have discussed the various methods to reverse a number in Java program. To each and every program, compiler is added to execute the program. Along with it, sample outputs are also given citing various examples. The methods are:

Using While Loop
Using Static Method
Using Function
Using Recursion
Using While Loop
1) Entered value will be assigned to n and res=0.

2) While loop iterates until n!=0, if n=0 then the loop terminated and prints the res  value.

example n=153, the condition is true ,a=3, res=(0*10)+3=3, n=15
n=15 condition true, a=5,res=30+5=35,n=1
n=1,condition true, a=1, res=35*10+1=351,n=0, so while loop terminated and prints reverse number.
